*Purpose of this project:*
After much thought (and attempts to the contrary), I finally decided that I needed a C preprocessor for the "oclraster project":https://github.com/a2flo/oclraster to preprocess user provided OpenCL/oclraster shaders/programs. It will soon be added as a drop-in library.
Note: even though this project can still be compiled and used as a standalone binary/preprocessor, its use in that state is relatively limited, since I've removed most of the unnecessary command line and system specific functionality.
